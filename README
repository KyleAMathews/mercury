This is where I track pantheon 1.2 developments and try to keep them working 
on linode servers. The assumed starting point is a fresh 64 bit Ubuntu 10.04 
LTS install on linode. Simply log in as root and then execute the following 
commands:

apt-get install git-core
git clone git://github.com/boztek/mercury.git -b dev /opt/pantheon
cd /opt/pantheon
python setup.py
